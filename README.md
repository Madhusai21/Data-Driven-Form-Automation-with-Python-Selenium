# Data-Driven-Form-Automation-with-Python-Selenium

I’m excited to share my latest project—an automation script built in Python that leverages Excel and Selenium to streamline form filling on a web page.

#What it does:

1) Reads user data (like name, email, address, gender, country, etc.) from an Excel file using OpenPyXL.

2)Launches a browser and populates the web form dynamically using Selenium

Automatically selects checkboxes, dropdowns, and other form elements.

3) Iterates over multiple records and resets for each submission.

#Tech stack:

->Python

->Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.

->OpenPyXL for Excel read/write and formatting.

#Why it matters:

1) Saves time and eliminates manual data entry.

2) Easily scalable and reusable for data-driven testing or reporting Modular, maintainable, and adaptable—great for hands-on automation tasks.

#Would love feedback on improvements—especially ideas for enhancing performance or tracking submission status. Happy to walk anyone through the code more deeply!..
